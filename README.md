# Python-Projects
I automated web scraping using Python to collect data from a target website. I analyzed the website, used libraries such as BeautifulSoup and Scrapy to extract data, cleaned it with pandas and numpy, then visualized it using matplotlib and seaborn. The project enabled regular data collection for efficient decision-making.
